1. Use sudo yarn instead of sudo npm.
2. Make sure @types/react is the same version for both dependencies and resolutions in package.json  
    eg. "@types/react": "^18.0.15"
3. To change ownership of the release folder to me, use this command: sudo chown -R priyal-flat-rock:priyal-flat-rock release/
